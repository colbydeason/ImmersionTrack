Fix button programming so it doesn't look like sh*t

In OpenView command pass the window to the constructor of the new viewmodel (use new viewmodelbase for popup window)

change db location to appdata, also use new foreign key list / reference for use in total hours

use connection to create log and source at same time

View
            <StackPanel HorizontalAlignment="Left">
                <TextBlock HorizontalAlignment="Center" Text="Total Time"/>
                <TextBox Text="{Binding SourceDuration, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"/>
            </StackPanel>

View model
        private int _sourceDuration;
        public int SourceDuration 
        {
            get
            {
                return _sourceDuration;
            }
            set
            {
                _sourceDuration = (int) value;
                OnPropertyChanged(nameof(SourceDuration));
            }
        }

StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml" - > OG startup 

d:DesignHeight="500" d:DesignWidth="1600" - > desired values for immersion time
mc:Ignorable="d" - > design time values, don't show up on application
SizeToContent="WidthAndHeight" - > for mainwindow
Height="450" Width="800" - > OG Window size

Structure ideas:
	Source: Ability to add a source, restriction on source type and name are the same
			Ability to view current and past sources
			Ability to "Complete" a source
	Log: 
			Ability to Add a log w/ or w/out the timer value
			Ability to view logs from certain days or spans of days
