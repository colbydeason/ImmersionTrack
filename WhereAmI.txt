Working DI, possibly create a service for navigation so it doesn't need to be in constructor.
Added connection (?) to the database through Sequel server, but don't know how to use it now.
Following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STt3U122wiU&t=372s, ran migration and have db set up in bind, but no services or
mappings to actually use it yet (stopped at 16:40, trying to use constructor with services). Now watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et2khGnrlqc&list=PLLWMQd6PeGY3b89Ni7xsNZddi9wD5Esv2&index=1 
to learn how connections and queries actually work and how simple they can be without dto, factory, and all that crazy stuff.

Fix Int field for string for duration

Data Context works, make changes so you can use main window at the same time, but can't open another create source window
When the button reloads, the canExecute reloads and it can open a new one

Fix button programming so it doesn't look like sh*t

Add new view model for the popup windows so they can take in the window in the constructor  (or maybe use an event?) so they close after creation.

The source dropdown shows name and Guid, I want the front end to know both, display the text, return the selected pair or the key

change db location to appdata, also use new foreign key list / reference for use in total hours

StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml" - > OG startup 

d:DesignHeight="500" d:DesignWidth="1600" - > desired values for immersion time
mc:Ignorable="d" - > design time values, don't show up on application
SizeToContent="WidthAndHeight" - > for mainwindow
Height="450" Width="800" - > OG Window size

Structure ideas:
	Source: Ability to add a source, restriction on source type and name are the same
			Ability to view current and past sources
			Ability to "Complete" a source
	Log: 
			Ability to Add a log w/ or w/out the timer value
			Ability to view logs from certain days or spans of days
