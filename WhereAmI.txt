Working DI, possibly create a service for navigation so it doesn't need to be in constructor.
Added connection (?) to the database through Sequel server, but don't know how to use it now.

Data Context works, make changes so you can use main window at the same time, but can't open another create source window
When the button reloads, the canExecute reloads and it can open a new one

Fix button programming so it doesn't look like sh*t

Figure out why the hell everything is so fucking massive

StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml" - > OG startup 

d:DesignHeight="500" d:DesignWidth="1600" - > desired values for immersion time
mc:Ignorable="d" - > design time values, don't show up on application
SizeToContent="WidthAndHeight" - > for mainwindow
Height="450" Width="800" - > OG Window size

Structure ideas:
	Source: Ability to add a source, restriction on source type and name are the same
			Ability to view current and past sources
			Ability to "Complete" a source
	Log: 
			Ability to Add a log w/ or w/out the timer value
			Ability to view logs from certain days or spans of days
