Currently this application only contains a stopwatch to track immersion time, but will eventually become a full application.
The application will be used to keep personal logs regarding language learning immersion, and view visual breakdowns of information related to the logs.
Eventually I would also like for it to export the logs in a way to interface with the Nijika discord bot, and possible anki integration as well.
