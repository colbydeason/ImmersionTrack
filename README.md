# Mayuri
This application will eventually contain a way to log and track immersion for studying another language. It currently only features the Home Page, and the Stopwatch. The Stopwatch will also eventually be integrated into the logging system, so that you can export it from the Stopwatch to a new log.
## Home Page

Note: The stopwatch will continue running in the background, regardless of minimization of the application, or navigation away from the Stopwatch  (to the Home Page, for example)
